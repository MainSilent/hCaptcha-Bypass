# hCaptcha-Bypass

ðŸ”´ This script is mostly deprecated but still works if you have `hc_accessbility` token, I'm currently working on other methods of bypassing.

Bypass for hCaptcha with Token key

1- Get captcha key from Hcaptcha accessibility copy the button link and past only the code at the end of url in .env

2- Then run captcha_token.py to get accessibility cookie

3- When getting the cookie make sure you copy the link and open it in second tab

4- Now you can run main.py to get captcha key

Note: You need to refresh the cookie every 24 hours
